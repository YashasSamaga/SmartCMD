## Smart Command Processor

SmartCMD, also known as iZCMD+, is a fast feature rich command processor which simplifies the creation and handling of commands. SmartCMD is iZCMD loaded with new features but ironically, it is faster than iZCMD. SmartCMD works on the same principle which iZCMD/ZCMD works on, i.e: create commands as public functions and call the public function when the command is used. However, there are few subtle changes in the core algorithm to make allowances for the features.
